It is considered to be, that in youthful people, the ideal ratio of the vertical height of the upper lip to that of the lower lip is 1:1.6 (Mandy et al). Meanwhile, in a 2017 study (Heidekrueger et al) researchers found that an upper to lower lip ratio closer to 1:1 was considered the most attractive. These findings are more consistent with recent trends in cosmetic medicine, with many clients aiming for a fuller upper lip.",
