Thread lifts will be ineffective due to the large mass of tissues in the lower third of the face - the threads will not withstand such a load. Also, do not expect much from skin care cosmetics or lipolytics. And to increase the volume of the middle third of the face, volumetric plastic with fillers is ideal. If your face is not prone to puffiness, you can use preparations based on hyaluronic acid. If the face periodically swells, fillers based on calcium hydroxyapatite will be the drug of choice. Also, a good result can be achieved by lipofilling. At the same time, excess adipose tissue can be taken just from the lower third of the face. Thread lifts of the middle third of the face will also be effective. This procedure will return the sagging soft tissues of the middle third of the face into place.
